'''
1. Prepare the Dataset: Collect a dataset containing images, questions related to the images, 
   and the corresponding answers. The dataset should be split into training, validation, and test sets.
2. Preprocess the Data: Implement preprocessing for both the images and text. For images, this
   typically includes resizing, normalization, and patchification. For text, it involves tokenization 
   and padding/truncating to a consistent length.
3. Define the Model: Ensure you have the model architecture defined correctly, including both the 
   vision and language parts, and that it's suitable for the question-answering task.
4. Implement the Training Loop: Write a training loop to feed batches of data through the model, 
   calculate loss, and update the model weights.
5. Choose a Loss Function: For a question-answering task, this might be a cross-entropy loss between 
   the predicted answer tokens and the actual answer tokens.
6. Choose an Optimizer: An optimizer like Adam is a common choice for training deep learning models.
7. Evaluate the Model: Implement evaluation metrics specific to question-answering, like accuracy, to 
   assess the model performance on the validation set.
8. Fine-Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters, model architecture, and data preprocessing based on performance 
   on the validation set.
9. Regularization and Early Stopping: To prevent overfitting, use techniques like dropout, weight decay, 
   or early stopping based on validation performance.
